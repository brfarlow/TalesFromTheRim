## Contributors

There is a long list of contributors over the years that have contributed to making the many varieties of Mudlibs. Please take note of the following note:
```
This is a beta release of EmpireMUD 2.0. It is based on CircleMUD 3.0 and thus
most of the CircleMUD README file has been maintained within this document.

Information about CircleMUD can be found at its home page:
http://www.circlemud.org

Out of respect for our hard work, I ask that you keep all of my credits in
tact (including the headers in each of the files) and maintain your own
integrity by properly respecting all contributors.

Use of this software in any capacity implies that you have read, understood,
and agreed to abide by the terms and conditions set down by the CircleMUD
license contained in the file license.doc.

Also, out of courtesy if nothing else, please keep the 'credits' file intact.
You can add your own credits on top of the existing file, but I'd appreciate
it if you would not simply remove it and all references to the word "Circle"
everywhere in the MUD.
