This directory contains some supplemental utilities including the map
generator. You must run the 'configure' script in the mud's root directory
before you can compile here. This directory automatically compiles when you
use 'make all' in the src directory.

All of these utilities compile into empiremud/bin except the map generator.
See the main README file for instructions on using the map generator.
