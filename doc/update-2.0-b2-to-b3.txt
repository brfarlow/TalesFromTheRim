=======================================
Updating EmpireMUD from 2.0b2 to 2.0b3:
=======================================

WARNING: You will need to convert your playerfile for this upgrade. If you used
any of the "spare" variables in player_special_data_saved, you need to update
the playerfile converter to preserve your spares. If you haven't made any code
changes, that step isn't necessary.

Step by step instructions:

1. Shut down your EmpireMUD using "shutdown die".

2. Create a backup of your MUD.

3. Update your code to 2.0b3 using git, or by creating a patch on the GitHub
site. (Usually you should "git stash", "git pull", then "git stash pop").

4. If any of your own changes conflict, you must resolve conflicts in those
files. Conflict sections look like this:

  <<<<<<< Updated upstream
    ...
  =======
    ...
  >>>>>>> Stashed changes

Your original code is between the === and >>> lines (the bottom part). The top
portion is the change from the repository. You'll have to reconcile the two
sections and remove the <<<, ===, and >>> lines.

5. You will need to manually add the following to src/utils/Makefile (this file
was generated when you configured your EmpireMUD and isn't updated by the
patch):

  5a. In the "all:" block, add:

    $(BINDIR)/plrconv-20b2-to-20b3

  5b. After the "plrconv-20b1-to-20b2:" line, add a new section:

    plrconv-20b2-to-20b3: $(BINDIR)/plrconv-20b2-to-20b3

  5c. At the end, add this block:

    $(BINDIR)/plrconv-20b2-to-20b3: plrconv-20b2-to-20b3.c $(INCDIR)/conf.h \
       $(INCDIR)/sysdep.h $(INCDIR)/structs.h $(INCDIR)/utils.h
       $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $(BINDIR)/plrconv-20b2-to-20b3 plrconv-20b2-to-20b3.c

6. Compile your MUD using "make all". This will also compile the playerfile
converter.

7. Use the playerfile converter to update your playerfile:

  7a. Change directory into lib/etc:

    cd lib/etc

  7b. Rename your existing playerfile:

    mv players player.old

  7c. Convert your playerfile:

    ./../../bin/plrconv-20b2-to-20b3 players.old players

8. Start up your MUD. Warning: If your playerfile wasn't correctly converted
and was corrupted, the player with ID #1 may still be able to log in, but all
other players will fail. You should verify that your game is running correctly.
